- Follow ARCHITECTURE.md, DECISIONS.md, AGENTS.md strictly.
- Do not introduce new frameworks, databases, auth providers, or major libraries without explicit approval.
- Keep business logic out of route handlers; handlers are thin adapters only.
- Prefer small commits and incremental changes.
- If a task is architectural or ambiguous, stop and ask for a decision (update DECISIONS.md if needed).
- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Avoid magic abstractions.
