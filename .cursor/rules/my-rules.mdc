# Cursor Project Rules

For any non-trivial task:

1) Always reference operational rules:
   - @docs/PROJECT_RULES.md
   - @docs/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md

2) Add narrative context when relevant:
   - @ARCHITECTURE.md
   - @DECISIONS.md
   - @AGENTS.md

3) Do not introduce new dependencies unless explicitly requested.

4) Do not make architectural decisions.
   If a decision is required, stop and ask.

5) Limit changes to files explicitly mentioned.

6) Use existing UI primitives and CSS tokens.
   Avoid hardcoded colors.

7) Do not run shell commands unless explicitly allowed.
