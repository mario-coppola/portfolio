# Agents Working Agreement

This repository uses AI assistance.

AI agents are collaborators, not decision makers.

---

## Core principles
- Optimize for clarity and maintainability
- Prefer explicitness over assumptions
- Incremental changes over sweeping refactors

---

## Responsibilities
- Architecture, design direction, and trade-offs are human-owned
- Agents execute well-scoped, mechanical tasks

---

## Boundaries
Agents must stop and ask when:
- requirements are ambiguous
- architectural choices are involved
- more than a few files are impacted
- a new dependency is suggested

---

## Reference
Practical, day-to-day usage rules for agents are defined in:
- `docs/AGENT_PLAYBOOK.md`
