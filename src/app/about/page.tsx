        I work through small, intentional steps and defensible decisions.
        My focus is on building web applications that balance technical
        correctness with product needs.

        I care deeply about performance, SEO, accessibility, and long-term
        maintainability. Code quality matters, but only insofar as it helps
        deliver a better product and reduces future complexity.
